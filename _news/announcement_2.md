We're thrilled to announce that our paper "Advanced Neural Architectures for Medical Image Segmentation" has been accepted at CVPR 2026! This work presents a novel approach to multi-organ segmentation achieving state-of-the-art performance.

***

**Abstract**: We propose a new deep learning framework that combines attention mechanisms with multi-scale feature extraction for accurate medical image segmentation. Our method achieves significant improvements over existing approaches while maintaining computational efficiency.

**Key Contributions**:
- Novel attention-based architecture for medical imaging
- Multi-scale feature fusion strategy
- State-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets
- Real-time inference capability

**Authors**: [Student Name], [PhD Student], [Professor Name]

**Conference**: IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2026

**Results**: Our method achieves 95.3% Dice coefficient on the benchmark dataset, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by 3.2%.

Stay tuned for the camera-ready version and code release on our GitHub!
